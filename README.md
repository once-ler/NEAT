#### What is it?
Not a stack or framework.  More like an amusement park.
Think Disney World.  Magic Kingdom or Epcot, why not both?

The goal of this project is to make open healthcare data useful.
Someone has to do it.  Why not you or me?

#### Let's brainstorm
NLP, fulltext search, recommendation engine, predictive analytics,
social graphs, patient relation graphs, and (your idea here) graphs!
